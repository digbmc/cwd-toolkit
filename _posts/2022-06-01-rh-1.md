## 06/01/2022's Reflection Log

Understanding the basic concepts of html and css went well today. But incorporating them together seemed very complex at first but then I visited W3 school’s website where they had tutorials for almost everything that a person needs to know to build a website, which was very helpful in clearing some of the concepts. Seeing their tutorial and typing down the commands side by side and seeing the changes was pretty fun.

However, it was also a lot of trial and error work while making the website. Sometimes, it was frustrating while encountering errors, but then I realized that a minor error like a semi-colon or spelling mistake was causing the error.

We also had a workshop about Inclusive Design today. The accessibility part of inclusive design was already known to me, but it was very interesting to be able to see things from a bigger perspective. With the help of empathy to understand what the larger audience might be thinking of a certain thing was a new thing for me. The activity that we did where we had to design a wallet for our partner based on their preferences was a valuable experience while having a lot of fun at the same time.
