## 06/06/2022's Reflection Log

Understanding the different modes of instruction was very important and helpful as it gave a clearer view of how we can structure our resources/website in a way that would make it efficient for the readers to learn from.

Learning the different working mechanisms of different softwares that are usually used for making different modes of instructions were kind of interesting but difficult to keep track of, as I had never seen these softwares before.

I was already aware of the visual and auditory modes of instruction but a new insight was the podcast option for the auditory mode, which seemed like a pretty innovative and an efficient way to absorb information. Emphasizing the previous point, we also talked about how people can multi-task if the auditory mode of instruction is available to them. I also got to know about different softwares used for these instructional materials, which was new information for me. Knowing about WeVideo was very interesting to me as I always wanted to learn to use a video software like this but never got the chance so it will be a fun experience if we get to use this software at some point.

The aspect of Digital Pedagogy which I think is the most applicable is the Multimodal option, as most people tend to absorb information better when the mode of instruction is made up of a combination of visual, auditory, and other forms of instructions.
