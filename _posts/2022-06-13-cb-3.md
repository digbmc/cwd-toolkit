Today we began working on a website that will host our DSSF blog. We created a basic wireframe for our site, then we set up a GitHub repository so we can collaborate on the code. We will be using Jekyll to build our static site. We also created a spreadsheet to manage tasks.

## Wireframing

We created both a text-based outline of our plan for our website and some pencil-and-paper sketches.

## Set up GitHub repository for collaboration

We set up a GitHub repository to host our files for now so that we can work on the code together. We have separate branches that we work on, and then we create pull requests to merge our changes into the master branch.

## Jekyll

Although we are using jekyll, we plan to create our own layouts and formatting with html and css. Some of the time today was spent getting the jekyll site set up and going over what each folder and file in the repository does and how Jekyll uses them.

## Began adding sections to website

We created a barebones version of the site with the main pages and navigation bar that we planned in our wireframe.

## Spreadsheet to manage tasks

We are using a Google Sheets spreadsheet to manage tasks. We hope that this will help to mitigate/avoid conflicts as we all collaboratively work on the GitHub repository.
