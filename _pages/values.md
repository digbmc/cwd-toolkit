The Critical Web Design Toolkit Project aims to not only bring awareness to the environmental impact that websites have on energy consumption, but to also tackle the issues of the digital divide, accessibility, and the social and moral implications of web development tools and current practices (taken from our project charter).  

## Sustainability 

Contrary to popular belief, the internet and the servers required to host it are considerable consumers of energy and, as a result, contribute to CO2 emissions.[^1] In order to reduce the environmental impact of digital scholarship, the CWD Toolkit was created as a static site. As opposed to dynamic sites like Wordpress and Squarespace which re-generate every time you open them, static sites only need to be loaded onto your computer once to function. Thus, static requires a lot less energy.  

While it is challenging to quantify exactly how much energy is saved using static sites rather than dynamic ones, using the carbon calculator online tool can calculate how many grams of CO2 is released. If you want to try for yourself, [put the link to your favorite website into the Website Carbon Calculator linked here](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). 

In addition to using a static site basis, we used compression and dithering techniques to reduce the size of every image on our site, which increases speed and reduces emissions.

## Accessibility 

In order to ensure maximum website accessibility, we focused on both the digital divide and general website accessibility for those with disabilities. With most websites, it is easy to achieve a highly accessible user experience and should always be integrated into the development process.   

One roadblock to internet access is download times and loading speeds.[^2] Given that static sites are generally lightweight and only need to be loaded once, the CWD Toolkit template is not only more sustainable, but also more accessible on lower internet bandwidths. 

According to an article by Pablo Stanley for UX Collective, there are over 56 million people in the United States (nearly 1 in 5) and over 1 billion people worldwide who have a disability.[^3] To ensure ease of navigation and site clarity for those with disabilities, we conducted site accessibility tests using the [WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). This free program tests accessibility for tab navigation, headers, color contrasts, alt text for screen readers, and general clarity.
